In React, components are designed to follow the natural cycle of life. They are born (creation), grow (updating), and finally die (deletion).

If the value of the previous state or props and the new state or props is the same, the component is not re-rendered. Pure Components restricts the re-rendering ensuring the higher performance of the Component",id:2},

If your function component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React. memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result.
